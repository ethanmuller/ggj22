today i'm going to track if somebody is nodding
so i need to have a tonejs metronome
but first i will

input phase 1 was a success!: count up when crossing horizon threshold downwards
        store a lastY value
        if it was above 0 but now below 0, change bgc
                increment X
overshot a little, but that's okay

audio phase 1 goal: tone js metronome ding pan left, ding on shift pan right
starting 2:45pm
overshot to 3:38
should just do hour blocks instead, easier to estimate
success!

next: visualize tonejs
        spheres in grid

vr is cool because you can make locations
and experiences in locations
will events in vr be more memorable?

so i'm gonna need to
get camera position
look at it over time
render position in corner of view
maybe as text and as an object

you can't add angles as vectors
